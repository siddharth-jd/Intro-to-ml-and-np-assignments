# TF-IDF Comparison

## Objective
Compare manual TF-IDF scores with scikit-learn's `CountVectorizer` and `TfidfVectorizer` using a small text corpus.

## Summary
- `CountVectorizer` gives raw word counts.
- `TfidfVectorizer` and manual TF-IDF give weighted scores based on how important a word is across documents.
- Common words like "the" have low TF-IDF scores because they appear in all documents.

- `Assignment_2.1.ipynb`: Code for manual TF-IDF and comparisons.
